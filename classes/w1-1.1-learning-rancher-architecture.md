## Architecture Concepts

**Cluster**:
- Upstream Cluster (the Kubernetes cluster with Rancher Server)
- Downstream Cluster (the Kubernetes clusters running workloads)

**Backup**: `etcd` (it is possible to recover Rancher config and data from an *etcd backup*)

**Rancher Management Server**:
- `RKE`
- `K3s`

**HA**:
- **etcd** components: 3 nodes
- **Control Plane** components: 2 nodes

**Cluster Controller**:
- One for each cluster managed by Rancher

**Agents**:
- Cluster agent: one for each cluster
- Node agent: one for each node (DaemonSet)

**Authentication x Authorization**:
- Authentication: handled by Rancher
- Authorization: handled by Kubernetes

**Authorized Cluster Endpoint**: direct connection when Rancher is down

### Best Practices

**Versions**:
- Docker version of Rancher: run on a dedicated/isolated node
- Kubernetes version of Rancher: run on a dedicated RKE cluster

**If production workloads**:
- HA Rancher cluster
- Layer 4 Load Balancer in front of an HA Rancher cluster
- Avoid SSL termination on the load balancer
- Upstreams and downstream cluster in the same region
- If multiple regions, keep Upstream in the central
- Layer 4 Load Balancer in front of controlplane nodes if using Authorized Cluster Endpoint
- Upstream cluster needs to grow according to the number of the attached Downstream clusters
